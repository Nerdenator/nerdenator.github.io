                <h3>Good day.</h3>
                <p>I'm a guy in his 20s who likes to write code. Making a website means writing code, so I made one. Here you'll 
                    find all of the stuff I've done throughout my admittedly short career. I was born and reside in the Northland of Kansas City, 
                    Missouri. Please, take a look around, and make sure to check back later, as I'll be posting new stuff more and more often.
                    <br/>
                    <h3>Other assorted, mostly useless facts:</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>I drive a red domestic mid-sized sedan.</li>
                        <!--<li>I like cats better than I like most people.</li>-->
                        <li>I think that Black Sabbath's <i>Dehumanizer</i> is under-appreciated and is the kind of album you can only get when you 
                            have two major talents (Ronnie James Dio and Tony Iommi) butting heads in the studio, but when they're at a 
                            stage in their careers when they know how to control their disdain instead of letting it consume them.
                        </li>
                        <li><i>The Venture Brothers</i> is the only TV show I have on DVD.</li>
                    </ul>

          <h2>NFCare</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>A piece from my time in the Cult of Windows Phone, NFCare is a system for the tracking and tagging of NFC (Near-Field Communications) tags. It allows users to upload when and where they scanned an NFC tag to a database and said tags can be marked as malicious if they carry a malware payload. It was also a semester project for my C#, Web Development, and Cybersecurity classes. The project itself was implemented in C# for Windows Phone, PHP, HTML/JavaScript/CSS, Bootstrap, and SQL.

          <h2>Mileduino</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>My capstone project at the University of Missouri. Mileduino makes use of hardware controlled by an Arduino microcontroller that interfaces with the OBD2 CAN port on the underside of a car's dash. Using this and a GPS unit, the hardware can map the approximate fuel efficiency of a vehicle at a given point in its route. It also features a serial display in order to give real-time feedback to the driver. Mileduino also uses a web component developed by one of my teammates that displays this data on a map on a webpage based on the Ruby on Rails framework.

          <h3>SurrealCraft</h3>
          <p>SurrealCraft is a stop-motion film I made paying tribute to Minecraft and <a href="https://kaalus.wordpress.com/">SurvivalCraft</a>. Props were simple blocks made from cardboard and paper, with paint to make them look like the blocks in the game. The footage was shot with a Canon Vixia and the composition was made with Adobe AfterEffects on Microsoft Windows.</p>

          <h2>Electronics/Programming</h2>
          <p>Some of these projects have their source code featured on the code tab.</p>
          <h3>ACL Gold</h3>
          <p>ACL Gold is a research project at the University of Missouri's <a href="http://eldertech.missouri.edu/docs/Gray%20-%20ACL.html">Center for Eldercare and Rehabilitation Technology</a> under the direction of Dr. Aaron Gray, MD and Dr. Marjorie Skubic, PhD. This project makes use of a Microsoft Kinect sensor to measure joint angles within the lower body during jumps to determine the likelihood of future ACL injuries in athletes, as posited by Dr. Timothy Hewitt's <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3096145/">paper</a> on the subject. My role was programming the application and testing it at the lab in conjunction with Dr. Erik Stone, PhD. The executable itself was a Windows program making use of WPF (Windows Presentation Foundation) and C#, developed in Visual Studio. The program was used in a long-term study to measure the effectiveness of such technology in prediction of future ACL injuries.</p>
          <h3>Stovepop</h3>
          <p>Stovepop is the name for my planned clustered compilation infrastructure, targeted at the building of customized Linux kernels. Stovepop has the following components:
              <ul>
                  <li>A web browser application written in HTML5/CSS3/JavaScript that acts as a graphical user interface (GUI) for the selection of kernel compilation options and control of the compilation process.</li>
                  <li>A server-side web application written in Ruby on Rails and Bash that carries out the actual compilation and manages the storage of configuration information.</li>
                  <li>A relational database management system (RDBMS) server that allows the storage of kernel compilation configurations so that they can be built on-demand and shared with other users.</li>
                  <li>A cluster of servers using technologies like distcc and ccache to accelerate compilation of the kernel code.</li>
              </ul>
              Currently, Stovepop is in the planning and testing phase, using a small cluster made up of Raspberry Pi 2 nodes.
